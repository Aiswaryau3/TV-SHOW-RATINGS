# 📺 TV Show Ratings Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on TV show ratings to understand viewing trends, audience preferences, and content characteristics. Using Python, the dataset is cleaned, structured, and analyzed through meaningful visualizations to extract actionable insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze the distribution of TV show ratings
* Identify trends across languages, genres, and runtimes
* Explore relationships between ratings and other features
* Practice real-world data cleaning and visualization techniques

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas – data manipulation
* NumPy – numerical operations
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled missing and null values
* Converted data types where necessary
* Processed categorical and numerical features

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

* **Univariate Analysis:** Rating distribution, runtime frequency, language count
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Ratings vs runtime, ratings by language
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Correlation heatmaps and pivot-based visualizations

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains TV show details such as title, rating, average runtime, language, genre, and release-related information.

## 📈 Key Insights

* Identified rating trends across different languages
* Observed variations in runtime for highly rated shows
* Discovered relationships between ratings and show attributes
